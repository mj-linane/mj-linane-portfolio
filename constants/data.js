      `I've been developing full-stack applications since 2014. I got started with Wordpress designing and building single pages (landing, contact, product launch) and customizing themes and wiring up API services like Stripe. I like to think that I was doing JAMstack before it was cool. My main focus was building learning experiences and platforms for K12 teachers and students.`,
      `I have since moved on from Wordpress, and have been working with front-end frameworks React.js and Vue.js. I like to design my ideas in Figma and then use UI libraries Bootstrap and Tailwind to build out the products.`,
      ` For the backend, I have experience using a number of different languages and frameworks such as, JavaScript/Express, Python/Django, C# and Java.`,
        `I have come a long way from my first web development experiences of crashing live sites as I updated them to now building applications that are modern, scalable, performant, and maintainable.`
